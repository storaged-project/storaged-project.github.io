	<h1>About Storaged</h1>
	<p>The Storaged project provides a daemon, tools and libraries to access and
	manipulate disks and storage devices.</p>
	<p>The code has its origins in the
	<a href="http://udisks.freedesktop.org/docs/latest/">udisk2</a> project
	which is being developed for the GNOME desktop environment needs. The
	focus of the Storaged is the D-Bus API suitable for wider audience than
	just the desktop applications.</p>
	<p>There are two variants of the API provided by Storaged: one is Storaged-specific meant to be parallel-installable
	with udisks2 and second that aims to be complete drop-in replacement for udisks2 providing all the features of udisks2
	together with the new modules.</p>
	<h1>License</h1>
	<p>See the
	<a href="https://github.com/storaged-project/storaged/blob/master/COPYING">COPYING</a>
	file for the license. In a nutshell, the daemon and tools are licensed under the GPLv2
	(or later) and libraries are licensed under LGPLv2 (or later).</p>
